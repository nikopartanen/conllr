# A test with CONLL-U files in R

This repository contains scripts Niko Partanen has used to work with CONLL-U files. They are wrapped into a package for the convenience, but this doesn't mean that the work would be in any sense complete or working.

The most interesting part of this work is a test with using [conllu.js](http://spyysalo.github.io/conllu.js/) JavaScript library within an RMarkdown document, so that it would be easy to embed UD examples into HTML documents. conllu.js allows displaying graphically trees annotated in CoNLL-U format. The library is done by Sampo Pyysalo. All JavaScript, CSS and HTML files are more less directly taken from the examples on [conllu.js](http://spyysalo.github.io/conllu.js/) website. 

[Example here](https://nikopartanen.github.io/conllr/conllr.html) demonstrates how I have been using the package.
